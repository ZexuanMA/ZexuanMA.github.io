<h3>Hi there, I'm Zexuan Ma &#128075;</h3>
<p align = "justify"> 
  I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Physics in 2024 from <a href="https://www.bnuzh.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beijing Normal University</a> (BNU), China. From Sep. 2022 to May 2025, I worked as a research assistant under the supervision of <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2335-6969" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Li Ling</a> and <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9252-1417" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Yinghao Song</a>. Our research mainly focused on 
  developing an application-driven design framework based on our near-field model of optical fibers, which modulate light distribution profiles from uniform output over extended fiber lengths for catalytic reactions to intense localized output for sensing.
  quantifying the uncertainties of geophysical inverse problems, exploring natural hydrogen resources, and investigating the formation mechanisms of oceanic plateaus using marine magnetic data.

Before joining UH, I completed a two-year postdoctoral research program supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mvImZ_oAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Qinghua Huang</a> at PKU in 2023.
