<h3>Hi there, I'm Zexuan Ma &#128075;</h3>
<p align = "justify"> 
  I obtained my Bachelor's degree in physics in 2024 from <a href="https://www.bnuzh.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beijing Normal University</a> (BNU), China. I am currently working with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jiajiasun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Jiajia Sun</a> and <a href="https://modal.ece.uh.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Jiefu Chen</a> on quantifying the uncertainties of geophysical inverse problems, exploring natural hydrogen resources, and investigating the formation mechanisms of oceanic plateaus using marine magnetic data.
</p>
<p align = "justify"> 
Before joining UH, I completed a two-year postdoctoral research program supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mvImZ_oAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Qinghua Huang</a> at PKU in 2023.

<strong>My research interests include:</strong>
</p>
  
<ul>
<li>Uncertainty quantification of geophysical inverse problems based on machine learning techniques</li>
<li>Deep learning-based signal processing, modeling, imaging, uncertainty quantification of electromagnetic data, especially airborne electromagnetic data</li>
<li>Near-surface hydrological investigation</li>
<li>Hydrogen exploration</li>
</ul>
